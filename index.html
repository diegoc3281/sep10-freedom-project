            <p> We have all looked up at the night sky many times during our lives, wondering what's up there beyond our world. Astronomers, Cosmoligists, astrophysists, etc all study the vastness of space beyond our planet. 
                They use tools like telescopes to study and observe the universe. On 1969 we went to Space and had the first man on the moon. We studied the surface of the moon and gathered lots of data on our closest neighbor. 
                It took Apollo 11 a total of 3 days, 3 hours, and 49 minutes to reach the moon. It can get pretty lonely on the long journeys in space for our astronauts. Although, 3 days may not seem to long, in the future the 
                the human race will go to the further reaches of space and might take months or even years on the journeys. There was only 3 men on Apollo 11. Only seeing 3 people for months or only years will get boring. </p>
        
        <h1 class="part-a">Past/Present</h1>
            <p class id="telescopes">There has been lots of progress in the technology in the area of astronomy in the past hundred years. A common tool that was invented in 1608 was the telescope. It is not known who invented the telescope but 
                Hans Lipperhey announced a new lens-based seeing instrument that made distant objects appear much closer. This tool that was invented in the 1600's and is still used today. Modern day telescopes have been improved.
                Telescopes are used by scientist, astonomers, cosmologists, and even regular people. Astonomers use more advanced telescopes that allow them to study the univerese and find other plantes similar to ours. 
                You can get a telescope and stargaze out into the far reaches of space wondering where your descendentts might be one day in the cosmos.

        <h1 class="part-b">Future Ideas</h1>
            <p>  The future of space travel and one day having to move to another planet is looking promising. There might be a day we live on mars or a planet on a distant way galaxy. People have many ideas on where space travel 
            can go. Since the day Humans stepped on the moon, people have been fascinated all over the world about going to space. 
               <br>Public transportation to space/moon. Or as far as the current technology will allow us.
               <br>Put electronics to watch shows or movies and listen to music for long trips in space travel like they have on planes. 
               <br>A robot assistant in the spaceship (Inspired by the movie 'Interstellar').
               <br>A robot to keep you company
